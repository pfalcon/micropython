This is initial proof of concept port of MicroPython to Zephyr RTOS
http://zephyrproject.org. It only integrates with Zephyr's console
subsystem so far.

Supported out of the box is Zephyr's armv7-m (Cortex-M3) architecture,
with qemu_cortex_m3 being a default target. Supporting others architectures
may require editing makefiles.

To build:

Intstall Zephyr SDK and Zephyr source from the link above. Configure
Zephyr environment as described in its instructions. Then:

    make

To run in QEMU:

    make qemu

To build for a real board (see link above for supported Cortex-M boards):

    make BOARD=frdm_k64f
